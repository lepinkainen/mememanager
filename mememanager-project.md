# Project overview: Meme Organizer App

I want to create an application to store and organise meme images, it can be either a web app (self-hosted, no login) or anything that runs on macOS, multi-platform is optional (linux + windows)
It should be able to:

- take in images from: drag & drop, copy & paste and selecting via a file dialog
- allow the user to rename + tag the image with multiple tags and save it to the file system
- OPTIONAL: use a local LLM model via ollama or an online LLM via API to analyse and rename + tag the image automatically
- Searching for memes based on text search (image name + tags)
- If any metadata needs to be stored it should be in the image names or an sqlite database
- Meme images should be copyable from the application so that they can be pasted for sharing in discord and slack etc.
  What would be the best programming languages for this? My personal preferences are Python and Go for backend

# Meme Organizer App Development Todo List

## âœ… COMPLETED - Project Setup & Structure

  - ~~`requests` (for API calls)~~ - will add when needed for LLM
  - ~~`tkinterdnd2` (drag & drop support)~~ - removed due to system dependencies
- [x] Set up project directory structure:
  ```
  mememanager/
  â”œâ”€â”€ src/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
